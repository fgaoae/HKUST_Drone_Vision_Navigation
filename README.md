# HKUST Drone Vision Navigation
**Phase 1: Prototype Development (Spring 2026)**

A self-learning project to build a vision-guided autonomous drone for HKUST campus both inside and outside.

This repository contains the **first-phase prototype** - a minimal system that demonstrates landmark detection and autonomous flight in simulation, with initial hardware development.

**Started**: Feb 12, 2026

*This is an ongoing project. Phase 2 (Summer 2026) will extend to full campus navigation and use more techniques rather than vision alone to locate more accurately.*
